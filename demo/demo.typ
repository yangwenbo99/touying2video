  In this video, I am going to demonstrate the functionality of the touying to video tool.
]

== Advantages

#slide[
  - Automatic process
  #pause
  - Animation support
  #pause
  - Multiple text-to-speech backends
  #t2s(start_from: 1)[Our tool can convert Typst presentations generated by touying to a presentation video with AI voiceover.]
  #t2s(start_from: 2)[
    It has good supports for animation.  For example, 
    I can configure the tool so that 
    the next bullet point will not appear until the current sentence is finished.
  ]
  #t2s(start_from: 3)[
    The tool supports multiple text-to-speech backends.  Currently, it supports Baidu's PaddlePaddle and OpenAI's TTS.

#slide[
  You can also use some hacks to generate animations.
  #duration(physical: (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))
  #t2s(start_from: 1)[
    You can also use some hacks to generate animations.

  #t2s(start_from: 2)[]

  #text(size: 100pt)[
    #set align(center)
    #only("2, 4, 6")[
      ðŸ˜€
    ]
    #only("3, 5, 7")[
      ðŸ˜„
    ]
  ]
]

== Liminations

#slide[
  - Currently, patched version of touying is needed
  #t2s(start_from: 1)[However, there are some limitations Currently, a patched version of touying is needed.]
  #pause
  - Rather slow video generated speed (due to MoviePy)
  #t2s(start_from: 2)[Its video generation speed is rather slow.  This is due to the fact that it uses MoviePy to generate videos.]
